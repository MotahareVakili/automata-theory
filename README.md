# DFA to Regular Expression Converter

This project is a Python-based program that converts a given Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) into a corresponding Regular Expression (Regex). The program handles the complete process of analyzing the states and transitions of the DFA and systematically reduces it to a single regular expression that represents the same language.

## Key Features
- **Input Handling:** Reads DFA transitions, states, start and final states.
- **Intermediate State Elimination:** Uses algorithms to remove intermediate states and combine transitions.
- **Regex Generation:** Produces the final regular expression equivalent to the given DFA.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Structures:** Uses lists, sets, and custom classes to manage DFA transitions and states.

To use the program, simply run the script and follow the input instructions to provide your DFA details. The program will output the equivalent regular expression.
